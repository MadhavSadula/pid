- **Subtitle:** Using Pyflowsheet and Gen AI

- **Your Name**

- **Date**



### Slide 2: Introduction

- Briefly introduce the purpose of the project.

- Explain what process flow diagrams (PFDs) are and their importance in chemical engineering.



### Slide 3: Overview of Pyflowsheet

- Explain what Pyflowsheet is.

- Highlight its capabilities for creating process flow diagrams.

- Mention the key components used (e.g., `Flowsheet`, `UnitOperation`, `Stream`, etc.).



### Slide 4: Code Structure

- Provide an overview of the code structure.

- Mention the main components of the code:

  - **Unit Definitions:** How units like `Distillation`, `HeatExchanger`, etc., are defined.

  - **Stream Connections:** How streams are connected between units.



### Slide 5: Creating a Flowsheet

- Explain how to create a `Flowsheet` object.

- Show a code snippet that demonstrates the creation of a flowsheet and the addition of units.

- Highlight the importance of positioning and connecting units.



### Slide 6: Generating the PFD

- Explain how the PFD is generated and saved as an SVG file.

- Show a code snippet that demonstrates the drawing and saving process.

- Mention any layout adjustments made for clarity.



### Slide 7: Example PFD

- Include an image of a sample PFD generated by your code.

- Briefly describe the components and connections in the diagram.



### Slide 8: Introduction to Gen AI

- Explain the role of Gen AI in automating the PFD generation process.

- Discuss the benefits of using AI for this task (e.g., speed, accuracy, ease of use).



### Slide 9: Gen AI Integration

- Describe how Gen AI is integrated into the project.

- Show the code snippet for the `CreateChatbot` function from `genai.py`.

- Explain how it generates Python code based on user input.



### Slide 10: Streamlit Application
